* About .emacs.d
  This is my personal Emacs configuration, I use Emacs to develop Python
  application, write shell script, tweak with emacs lisp, learning scheme, develop
  web project, read pdf file, chat on erc and so on, which are all based on this
  configuration
* About Emacs
  Typically, I live in Emacs, I almost do everything in Emacs except develop
  Java project.This is a life style
* File Structure
  Even though I though My .emacs.d is self-explaination, but it still a good
  idea to demonstrate its file structure.

* ScreenShot
  Even though screenshot could not describute an OS, but in my opinion it still
  could show you something. Gruvbox Theme:

  [[./images/emacs_screenshot1.png]]
  
  sr-speedbar+projectile+Eshell+Zenburn theme
  
  [[./images/emacs-screenshot3.png]]

  My mode line is spaceline. And my theme will change depending on time(For
  example, 6:00-18:00 is Zenburn, 18:00-6:00 is Gruvbox)
